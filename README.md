# Hybrid-DL-model-SOM-ANN - fraud detector
prediction of credit fraud using hybrid deep learning model - som + ann

business problem - detect potential fraud within customer applications applying for an bank credit card.

Used both unsupervised and supervised deep learning to solve the problem.
First - unsupervised deep learning - identify some potential fraud patterns in a high dimensional data set
Second - supervised deep learning - Input is from self-organizing map. Output is ranking of the predicted probabilities that each customer cheated.
